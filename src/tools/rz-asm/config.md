## Disassembler Configuration

The assembler and disassembler have many small switches to tweak the output.

Those configurations are available through the `e` command. Here there are the most common ones:

* `asm.bytes`: Show/hide bytes
* `asm.offset`: Show/hide offset
* `asm.lines`: Show/hide lines
* `asm.ucase`: Show disasm in uppercase
* ...

Use the `el asm.` for more details.
